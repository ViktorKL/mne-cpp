# MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for handwritten digits recognition is one of the most widely used image dataset for experimenting with different classification algorithms. MNIST has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example contains one digit that has been size-normalized and centered in a grayscale image at 28x28 pixel resolution.
